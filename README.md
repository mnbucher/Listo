Project for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lecture in Autumns Semester 2016 @ University of Zurich

## Frameworks

This project is built with Facebook's React to render the View and with Google's Firebase as a Database. The react stuff is in the file index.jsx, which is written in JSX and ES2015. All this is compiled with Babel to normal Javascript and bundled with Webpack to a single JS file.

## How to use this project

1. Clone Repo
2. ```cd``` to folder
3. run ```npm install``` in folder
4. run ```npm run dev``` for development mode or ```npm run build``` to compile a compressed file
